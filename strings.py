print "Hello i am a string"

age = 21
#below line will not give a correct value as string and number cannot be concatenated
#print "tuhin is " + age + "years old"

age  = str(21)

print "tuhin is " + age + " years old"

#another way to do this is using (``) BACKTICKS

age_mom = 47

print "my mom is " + `age_mom` + " years old"
